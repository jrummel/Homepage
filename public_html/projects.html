My team and I created this project my Sophomore year, it was the first time I had worked on a team with fellow programmers and was a really cool experience. I was primarily the Javascript developer."
	, "The application used your weight and gender to determine if you could safely drive (All theoretical of course. If you have to ask you need a cab...)"
	, "It could even call you a cab if you were to under the weather!"
	, "RU-Safe-2-Drive in action. The button with the drink on it used touch-screen technology for input."
	, "In my Senior year my software team and I were given the opportunity to build a new home on the web for SMIPO, Radford's Student Managed Investment Portfolio Organization. SMIPO manages a portfolio of over $1 million in investments and wanted their site to look more professional and be a place members, both current and former, could come together and discuss investments and employment opportunities."
	, "My primary responsibilies with the project was developing the Alumni connections pages and creating the forum. This is the about page which displayed current members, their ranks and departments. Most of this was done with Javascript."
	, "The forum features were much more interesting and fun to create. I used Php to handle the server side of things as well as to make SQL calls to our database."
	, "This is a photo of a user posting to a thread. I also included sanitization to prevent security risks like SQL or Javascript injection."
	, "The Christmas Tank is the brave story of Gizmo the Christmas Elf and his struggle to defend the North Pole from Nazi invaders during WWII. It was written in Java and used Slick2D to render images and what not."
	, "The Christmas Tank had varying levels of difficulty. Level one consisted of Nazi fighters attempting to bomb Gizmo into submission, but he did not yield!"
	, "Level two included red bombs, which would stay on the ground for a few seconds before disappearing."
	, "Finally level three added Japanese Kamikazi bombers to the fray, but still Gizmo struggled on. Eventually he claimed victory."
	, "This is a program written in Java that utilized threads. You inputted various files and the program would create a seperate thread for each file. That thread would then report back how many words were contained in the file. It was interesting to see which thread would finish first."
	, "This program was my first experience using a third party API and JSON objects. It queried the Guild Wars 2 servers, a game I played at the time, got a list of servers and then got a list of dynamic events happening on that particular server. In this image the program was no longer functioning because Guild Wars 2 had switched to 'Mega Servers', basically they merged all of their servers together and changed their API. I wanted to include it anyway. I have had other experiences with JSON objects such as using the JAXB library to retrieve JSON objects from XML documents, if you have questions for me please ask!"
	, "This is an image of a program I had to write for my procedural programming class. It detected if an input string was a palindrome in various forms. This program was written in Ada, a very type sensitive and fickle language. A fun class none the less."
	, "Although not necessarily a software project this is a picture of me (or my hands) assembling my brother's custom gaming PC. I have since built my own as well and feel like this is an important educational component for any aspiring computer scientist. Understanding what is happening under the hood can give you a greater insight into what you are doing. Since this picture I have also taken a class on an assembly language; something that I would not necessarily willingly do again but was fun and educational none the less."];
